This Repository is primarily to show, that the assignments of the module "Algorithmisches Programmieren" at my Uni have been done.

The Objectives of the Repo are to:
- better understand the programming language C++
- understand the algorithms implemented in C++
- learn algorithmic problem solving
- get aquaintanced with computers, programming and compilers
